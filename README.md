Welcome to the AirBnB clone project
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

Task 3
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel

Task 4
Update models/base_model.py:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
you will use *args, **kwargs arguments for the constructor of a BaseModel. (more information inside the AirBnB clone concept page)
*args won’t be used
if kwargs is not empty:
each key of this dictionary is an attribute name (Note __class__ from kwargs is the only one that should not be added as an attribute. See the example output, below)
each value of this dictionary is the value of this attribute name
Warning: created_at and updated_at are strings in this dictionary, but inside your BaseModel instance is working with datetime object. You have to convert these strings into datetime object. Tip: you know the string format of these datetime
otherwise:
create id and created_at as you did previously (new instance)

Task 5
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.

Now the flow of serialization-deserialization will be:
